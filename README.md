# Slimy-Scramble-
Slimy Scramble is a variation of the Nokia Snake game. Here, the player has to
unscramble the jumbled letters to form a word using the snake. The idea is
pretty simple, but the player has to play the snake game well and figure out the
word simultaneously.


How to play:

Initially, the snake just has the head. As correct letters are selected, its length
will increase. As soon as the player makes a mistake in selecting the letter, the
number of lives of the player will be decremented by 1. In each level, a player
has 3 lives.
The speed in the first level is extremely slow, enabling the player to get used to
the game. As the player moves on to higher levels, the speed goes on increasing.
The status of the word formed till now is displayed on the left. The time is also
shown. There is also a provision to see the high scores i.e. the maximum
number of words formed till now.
